a. What server framework did you choose and why?
	Ruby on Rails. Even though it is a new language to me, it enables to create much faster and maintainable project. The code here is very concise.

b. What client framework did you choose and why?
	JavaScript. I'm comfortable using JavaScript scripting language and it is pretty easy to implement the given requirements.
	
c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
	 I found creating ruby project, editing controllers, views and routes and running the project locally on localhost easy.
	 
d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
	For me, pushing the project to heroku and git hub was the toughest part. Because it was altogether completely new to me and tedious initially. 
	
e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
	nothing. I just installed ruby on rails and required components(postgres, git, etc.,)
	
f. What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
	I've deployed my project on windows, the commands required to deploy and run server are-
->ruby -v
->sqlite3 --version
->gem install rails
->rails new <project_name>
->cd <project_name>
->rails server.
